## Welcome to Parkbird coding challenge

Congratulations on passing the enterview! :smile: Getting to this point means that we liked your profile and we're looking forward to see how you approach to real-life problems :boom:.  Like we've talked before, there will be a challenge that will put your coding and problem solving habilities to the test :sunglasses:

### :runner: How to run the Project :runner:
 * Clone the files and run `npm install`
 * run `npm start` to start the development server

### :trumpet: The Challenge :trumpet:

Create a map-based-app using [Expo](https://expo.io/) that allow the user to quickly visualize information and data about places where he can park his vehicle through multiple Markers rendered on the map.

:exclamation: *You will find a file called **mockData.tsx** in the root folder with all the data you need.* :exclamation: 

#### In order to do this you're required to:
* Display a **swipeable panel** that displays the following when the user press on the marker:
		1. The place title.
		2. Image of the place.
		3. A button that allows the user to navigate to a new screen. In this new is screen the title and the description of this place are displayed.

* Set a **navigation based on bottom tabs** 
	   1. The first tab is for the Main screen
	   2. The second tab is for the Profile screen. No need to add nothing to this screen, just leave it blank.
	   
### :metal: Other Considerations :metal:
	
* Feel free to style the app how ever you want, give it your own personal touch. Use plain css, SASS, or styled components, etc.
* Use any state management tools (if you think is necessary to).
* Its at your discretion the use of type checkers. ex: Typescript.
* The choice of external libraries and tools is totally fine. Feel free to use any tool that you consider the best to solve the problem.

#### When you're done, upload your code to github and send us the link of your repo to:

`tomas@parkbird.com` and `tobias@parkbird.com`

Best of the lucks! :sparkles:
